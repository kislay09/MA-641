NON SEASONAL DATASET: NYC Weather

# PART B - Non-Seasonal Dataset
## Introduction
This project aims to perform a comprehensive time series analysis on weather data collected from New York Cityâ€™s Central Park in 2016. Time series analysis is a crucial statistical method used to analyze a sequence of data points collected over time intervals. Such analysis can reveal underlying patterns, trends, and seasonal variations, which are vital for forecasting and making informed decisions in meteorology, urban planning, and resource management.
